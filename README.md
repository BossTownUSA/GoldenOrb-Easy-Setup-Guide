# GoldenOrb Easy Setup Guide. 
Configure ROOter for first use.

After you unbox your GoldenOrb router and power it on, you'll have 2 physical connection options to setup the ROOTer:
  - First and rcommended option is  via Ethernet. Plug one end of a standard Ethernet cable into the LAN ports on the ROOTer and  the opposing end into a computer or Ethernet ready device. Assuming both the ROOTer and the connecting device are set to default network connection settings, you should automatically connect. Disabling WiFi on the connecting device or computer during this process will elimate additional problems.

  - Second option is via  WiFi. The default WiFi password for ROOTer as of 08/2020  is "rooter2017"  without quotes.

Now that  you have sucessfully connected to the ROOTer, open a clean web browser and  go to http://192.168.1.1
Make  sure you are NOT conencting to https://192.168.1.1 - notice the s after http should be missing.

First configuration we will do is changing the APN. The APN change should be the only default configuration change necessary to connect via cellular. From the left hand navigation menu select Modem > Connection Profile. From here we have the first form box labled simply, "APN". Here is a list of the default APN's  we should choose from depending on which SIM Card is being used, these are first choice Carrier Grade APN's. If an MVNO or 'reseller' SIM is being used, more APN research is necessarry outside this guide. (If these default APNs do not work, you do not have a proprer SIM, assuming ample signal is being provided and the ROOTer is fully functional):

 - Verizon
    - vzwinternet
 - AT&T
    - broadband
 - T-Mobile
    - fast.t-mobile.com
 - Sprint
    - r.ispsn

#######################################################

When you initially upgrade your router to a ROOter you must reconfigure the router setting to match your needs. This step is not needed when upgrading to a new ROOter version if you had the Keep Settings box checked. If it was unchecked then you must reconfigure it again.

The following are some of the areas that need to be configured in order to make proper use of your ROOter.



Click on the Go to password configurationâ€¦ link and it will take you to the section where you can enter the new password.



Enter the password, confirm it and then click on Save and Apply in the lower right corner. Wait until the changes take place.

Setting the Router Time
At this point we can set the time in the router. Click on the System menu and on the System submenu.



Select the correct Time Zone from the dropdown box, click on Sync with Browser, then click on Save and Apply in the lower right corner. Wait for the changes to take place.

If you plan to use Scheduled Reboot it is critical that you set the Timezone and time correctly for your area. If you don't then the reboot will not take place at the correct time.

Setup the WiFi
The next thing that we have to setup is the security for the router's WiFi. Select the Network menu and the WiFi submenu.



By default, the WiFi is enabled and is encrypted. The default password used is 'rooter2017'. Click on the Edit button for the top wifi interface.





Edit this data to suit the requirements of your WiFi system. The ESSID entry is the name of the router, set by default to ROOter. Change this to the name you want to see when connecting to the router via wifi. Set Channel to the desired channel number and the Width to 20 or 40 MHz.

To set the security of the wireless network, select the Wireless Security tab. When you select an Encryption type other than No Encryption the page will expand to allow more data entry.



Fill in the necessary data and click on Save & Apply in the lower right corner. Wait until the changes are applied.

Set the Router IP Address
By default the ROOter firmware sets the router to have an IP Address of 192.168.1.1. If you wish to change this to another address to avoid conflicts with other devices on your network, select the Network menu and the Interfaces submenu.



In the LAN row, click on the Edit button.



Change the IPv4 address to the IP Address you wish to assign to the router and click on Save & Apply in the bottom right corner. Wait for the changes to be applied.

Since the IP Address has been changed the web interface will stop working and continue to show that the changes are being applied. Wait for a few seconds and then change the URL on your web browser to the new IP Address of the router. You will then be able to log in again, this time using the new IP Address.
